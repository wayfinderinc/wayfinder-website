        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>SETF offers financial services to nearly 700,000 retail and lease customers across Southeast Toyota's 177 dealers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">Its website, SETF.com, is intended to enable the organization to market vehicles, promote offers, and service its customers and is the gateway for registered customers to manage their accounts and vehicles, make payments, explore offers and coupons, and get help.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">But the team that recently inherited the website saw an opportunity to improve the digital experience to boost the brand and rev up customer engagement.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The website significantly limited SETF's ability to control the presentation of content and while SETF ranks highly for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181119005864/en/", target="_blank">consumer financing satisfaction</a>, its website didn't positively extend or enhance the brand, was payment-focused, and offered little value-added content - providing no reason to stay - let alone stay in the driver's seat of a Toyota at the end-of-lease or once their last payment was made.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">SETF asked Wayfinder to address these challenges through calculated content and design improvements to maximize the impact on the customer experience while minimizing the impact on their existing processes and technologies. Add responsive design, a digital design system, and transition to development to the mix within a 10-week timeline and we had ourselves a challenge.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The website didn't clearly communicate the organization's offerings.</li>

          <li>Like the navigation, content, and promotions were generic and didn't consider the unique needs of their customers or their place in the customer journey.</li>
          <li>Page layouts were inflexible and inefficiently organized, limiting the organization's ability to make use of precious real estate.</li>
          <li>In-page messaging and notifications were impersonal and devoid of personality, challenging the organization's ability to connect with its audience.</li>
          <li>The search generated unexpected results and lacked features to easily refine and sort results making it difficult to find information.</li>
          <li>The few personalization features that were on the website were underused or didn't function.</li>

            <li><span class="fw-700 text-color-blue">Experience, Expertise, and Authority.</span><br />The project team was stacked with individuals with the experience, subject matter expertise, and the authority needed to drive clear decisions. This helped us to gather the intelligence we needed to inform our solutions, demystify industry-specific concepts, and collect thoughtful feedback more efficiently.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-700 text-color-blue">A Great Partner.</span><br />We're fond of saying, "When you work with us, you become a part of our team and we become a part of yours," and we mean it. From day one, we relied on email, text, Slack, online meetings, and face-to-face working sessions to stay connected and collaborate throughout the design process. Additionally, transparency, mutual respect, and trust between our teams made it easy to partner with the SETF team and let us speed delivery.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-700 text-color-blue">We're Fast.</span><br />We take pride in being able to quickly translate complex requirements into detailed and thoughtful deliverables. For the SETF.com redesign we were able to deliver high-fidelity wireframes, mockups, and prototypes within a day or two and sometimes hours of gathering knowledge or feedback.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-700 text-color-blue">Create. Test. Iterate. Repeat.</span><br />We regularly shared our ideas communicated through sitemaps, process flows, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to gather feedback and iterate as needed.</li>

        <p>The way we shop for and purchase or lease cars and trucks is quickly changing. But think about the last time you financed or leased a vehicle. How long did you spend shopping?

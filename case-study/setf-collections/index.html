        <p>SETF offers financial services to nearly 700,000 retail and lease customers across Southeast Toyota's 177 dealers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">Its website, SETF.com, is intended for registered customers to manage their accounts and vehicles, make payments, explore offers and coupons, and get help.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">Unfortunately, some of their customers experience financial hardship and fall behind on their required monthly paments which can lead into collections. Their traditional method to raise awareness and help the customer is not effective.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">The team that recently inherited the website saw an opportunity to improve its collections experience and position the brand as a hero.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-700">Traditional collection methods result in a negative experience.</span> The conversation rates from phone calls and mailed letters are extreamly low. If 60% of customers who are past due continue to log into their accounts we should use that digital opportunity to engage customers and raise awareness.</p>
        <p class="pt-p"><span class="fw-700">The current methods available to resolve these issues are not optimal.</span> Traditional collections phone calls and letters, although rational, can by dry. By humanizing the language used to communicate to customers in default we can create trust and drive them to respond to past due notifications.</p>
        <p class="pt-p"><span class="fw-700">We don't know why a customers account has gone into default.</span> By creating a customer centric, personalized and guided experience, we can drive higher engagement and deliver messages that most deeply sympathize with each one of them. Additionally, we can gather data to understand their situation and assist the collections department with an outreach strategy for each unique case.</p>

        <p>The relative success of customer-centric strategies and solutions hinge on an organization's willingness and ability to change its mindset and business processes to better serve its customers and spur real growth.</p>
        <p class="pt-p">The SETF team entered the process with a strong desire to improve the customer experience, a willingness to evangelize solutions with colleagues and management, and the ability to make clear decisions, which significantly eased the experience design process.</p>

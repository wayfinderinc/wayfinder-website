# Adding Assets - Wayfinder.ws

## Asset Folder Structure
Assets are stored in folders on the server according to post type, purpose and section.  It is recommended to upload assets to the Assets repo before creating/editing content, although that can certainly be done within the context of the Entry's form.

File system structure for assets is as follows:

* Post Images
 * gallery
 * video
* Review Images
* Tutorial Images
* Project Images
* Case Study Images
* Team Images
* Team Icons
* About Images
 * design
 * discover
 * intro
 * measure

 Files can be moved between folders as needed to support whichever editing paradigm you prefer, but the folder structure must be maintained.

## Adding Sources (folders)
Under 'Settings' / 'Asset Settings', you can add a folder by clicking 'New Source'.  Follow the example of existing sources for details.

## Image Transforms
Image transforms are also found under 'Settings' / 'Asset Settings', in the 'Image Transforms' tab.  These transforms allow us to dynamically create images at certain sizes JIT (on the fly) if they do not already exist.  If they do exist, then Craft is smart enough to serve the cached/previously built transformed asset.

All of the transforms necessary for the site in its current state are added, so you should not need to add any or modify existing.
